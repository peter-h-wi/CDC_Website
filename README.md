# Data Analysis about US Uninsured Population

This repository was made for participating Carolina Data Challenge 2021.

## Goal

Out goal is to find a (combination of) factor that has the most correlated to the uninsured population in large counties.

## Background
From the insurance companies' view, uninsured populations are our potential customers. If we can find out the common factors from those populations, we would be able to make effective customized strategies to reach out to the group. With the goal, we analyzed the data to find the common factors that they might have in common.

## Strategy
1. Focus on the largest counties
    We chose 100 counties of which uninsured population is the largest. As the population is large enough, we can avoid the extreme tendencies from small data.
2. Find the most correlated factors to the uninsured population
    We assumed that if there is a correlation between the uninsured rate and the factor X. In order to find the factor X, we compared factors such as income, disability, job, gender, and diploma to the uninsured rate.
3. Find the associations between the factor Xs.
    We found the factors that are correlated to the uninsured rate from the previous stage. In addition to that, we treid finding how each factor affects to the result as a combination. Thus, we visualized the relation between each factors.

## Conclusion
We found that the common factors that are shown in the most uninsured population group: 
- Low Income
- With a Disability
- Spanish/Hispanic/Latino Origin
- SNAP Recipient
- Employed in Mining/Construction Industry
- Less than High School

Also, we found that there is a correlation between:
- Low Income, Spanish/Hispanic/Latino Origin, Less than High School

Thus, in order to reach out to as many as possible customers, the insurance companies might need to make a marketing strategy to sell their insurance to the group.
